generations:
  - name: "First Generation (T30)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Nissan X-Trail was introduced as a compact SUV featuring distinctive boxy styling with emphasis on genuine off-road capability unusual in its segment. Built on Nissan's FF-S platform, it offered a capable all-mode 4x4 system with selectable 2WD, Auto, and Lock modes using an electronic coupling to distribute torque between the front and rear axles. The exterior design featured squared-off proportions with prominent wheel arches and upright greenhouse providing excellent visibility. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included 2.0L and 2.5L gasoline engines and a 2.2L diesel, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior emphasized durability with water-resistant surfaces, removable and washable seat covers on some variants, and practical features including multiple storage compartments and a wet storage area in the cargo floor. Notable for its combination of car-like on-road manners with respectable off-road capability, the first-generation X-Trail became particularly popular in Europe, Asia, and Australia, though it wasn't offered in North America where Nissan instead sold the more road-focused Murano."

  - name: "Second Generation (T31)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation X-Trail maintained the boxy, functional design ethos of its predecessor but with smoother contours and a slightly larger footprint. Built on Nissan's C platform shared with the Qashqai/Rogue, it continued to offer capable all-wheel drive systems with electronic hill descent control and an intelligent ESP system that incorporated understeer control. Powertrain options again varied by market but typically included improved versions of the 2.0L and 2.5L gasoline engines and 2.0L diesel, with transmission choices including manual and continuously variable transmission (CVT) options. The interior featured a more refined design while maintaining practical elements including water-resistant surfaces in some variants, fold-flat rear seats, and the innovative Utili-Track cargo system with movable tie-down points. Technology features expanded to include available navigation, Bluetooth connectivity, and a panoramic sunroof. This generation continued to balance on-road comfort with off-road capability, though with increased emphasis on interior refinement and technology, maintaining strong sales in global markets while the North American market continued to receive the separate Rogue model."

  - name: "Third Generation (T32)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The third-generation X-Trail adopted a significantly more modern and aerodynamic design while maintaining some of the model's traditional boxiness. For the first time, platform sharing with the North American Rogue became explicit, with the X-Trail and Rogue essentially the same vehicle with market-specific adjustments. Built on the Common Module Family (CMF) platform developed within the Renault-Nissan Alliance, it offered improved rigidity, refinement, and safety. Powertrain options varied substantially by market, including various gasoline and diesel four-cylinder engines, with transmission choices typically including manual and continuously variable options. The all-wheel drive system evolved to include multiple terrain modes. A significant addition was the optional third-row seat, allowing for seven-passenger capacity, though with limited space in the rearmost row. The interior featured a more premium design with higher quality materials, improved technology including NissanConnect infotainment, Around View Monitor camera system, and expanded driver assistance features as the generation progressed. A refresh in 2017 brought styling updates, interior refinements, and additional safety technology. The third-generation X-Trail balanced its traditional SUV appeal with crossover comfort, continuing its global popularity while maintaining separate branding from the mechanically similar Rogue in markets where both were sold."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (T33)"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The current X-Trail features bold, modern styling sharing many design elements with the North American Rogue but with market-specific adjustments. Built on an updated version of the CMF platform with increased use of high-strength steel and lightweight materials, it offers improved structural rigidity and refinement. The exterior design incorporates Nissan's V-motion grille, split-level headlight arrangement, and more muscular proportions than its predecessor. Powertrain options vary by market but include conventional gasoline engines and, notably, Nissan's innovative e-Power system in some regionsâ€”where a gasoline engine functions solely as a generator for an electric motor that drives the wheels, providing EV-like driving characteristics without requiring external charging. Advanced driver assistance expands with Nissan's ProPILOT system offering semi-autonomous driving capability on highways. The interior represents a significant upgrade with a more premium design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including an available 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.8-inch head-up display. Available in five and seven-seat configurations, it maintains the model's focus on family practicality while offering improved refinement and technology. The fourth-generation X-Trail positions itself as a more sophisticated, electrified offering while maintaining the versatility and capability that have defined the nameplate, continuing its global significance as one of Nissan's core models outside North America."
